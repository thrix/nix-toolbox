Make sure you are running a system with Toolbx installed.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>We are investigating how to run Nix Toolbox with <code>distrobox</code>. Until that time, using of <code>toolbox</code> is required.</p> <p>Create Nix Toolbox container</p> <pre><code>toolbox create --image ghcr.io/thrix/nix-toolbox:42\n</code></pre> <p>This will create the <code>nix-toolbox</code> the container.</p> <p>The Nix and Home Manager setup is then performed when you first time enter the container:</p> <pre><code>toolbox enter nix-toolbox-42\n</code></pre> Example <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>Do not be afraid, the next start of the container will be as quick as with Fedora Toolbox.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Depending on your setup, the first time setup can take a long time, especially if you already have some Home Manager configuration available.</p> <p>The Home Manager configuration is optional, and you can skip it to have only the <code>nix</code> command.</p> <p>After the Nix is installed, you can opt-in to install Home Manager.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>Currently, the project provides an empty Home Manager configuration. Please take a look at the Examples to get most out of Nix Toolbox. We are planning to throw out a more reasonable template later for easier onboarding.</p> <p>The home manager configuration is available at <code>~/.config/home-manager/home.nix</code>. When changing the Home Manager configuration it is a good practice to put it under revision control to keep history of your changes to be able to easily replicate the setup on another computer.</p>"},{"location":"uninstalling/","title":"Uninstalling","text":"<p>To remove Nix Toolbox from your system, delete the toolbox container:</p> <pre><code>toolbox rm -f nix-toolbox-42\n</code></pre> <p>To remove the nix store and the links to Nix programs:</p> <pre><code>sudo rm -rvf ~/.local/share/nix/ ~/.nix-profile\n</code></pre>"}]}
